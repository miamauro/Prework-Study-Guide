# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to introduce the upcoming material that students will learn in the next twelve weeks of bootcamp. In creating this webpage, I was able to see just a fraction of what developers do each day. I am learning that computers are everywhere in our daily lives, and being able to communicate with them will prove to be largely beneficial in the next step in my career.

## Usage

On this webpage, you'll find notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the DevTools console, you can see JavaScript at work! There, you'll find a list of the topics discussed in the prework modules, and even a suggestion as to which topic to study first.
